## Pincode Lookup App
This is a React-based web application that allows users to search for postal data by entering a pincode. The app uses an API provided by https://api.postalpincode.in to retrieve the data and display it on the page.

Clone the repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.com/your-username/pincode-lookup.git

# How to Use
Once the app is running, you can use it to search for postal data by entering a 6-digit pincode in the input field and clicking the "Lookup" button. The app will display the postal data for the corresponding pincode, including the name, branch type, delivery status, district, and division.

You can also use the filter input field to search for specific postal data based on the name. As you type in the filter field, the app will update the results to show only the data that matches your search criteria.
